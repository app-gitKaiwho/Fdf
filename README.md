# Fdf
42 Project about drawing wireframe

### Info
This project uses the minilibx from : https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux

![](https://github.com/app-gitKaiwho/Fdf/blob/main/42.gif)

### How to use
  after compiling, use "./fdf mapname.fdf" usable map stored under ./test_maps are used
 
### Explanation
I used Raycasting (which was i belive unusefully complex for this project)
even if in the end the raycast calcultion is nothing more than similar triangles formula

One big issue with my code : for an easy coloring based on height, every single pixel is casted after lines are being drawn, and not before which causes bad performance on big maps may correct later
