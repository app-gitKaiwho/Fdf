### Info

### How to use
  >After compiling, use "./fdf mapname.fdf".<br>
  >Usable map stored under ./test_maps are used (same goes if you want to create a new one)
 
### Explanation
  >I used Raycasting (which was i belive unusefully complex for this project)
  >even if in the end the raycast calcultion is nothing more than similar triangles formula

### Issues
  >One big issue with my code :<br>
  >For an easy coloring based on height, every single pixel is casted after lines are being drawn,
  >and not before which causes bad performance on big maps, may correct later
