42 Project about drawing wireframe

This project uses the minilibx from : https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux

One big issue with my code : for an easy coloring based on height, every single pixel is casted after lines are being drawn, and not before wich causes bad performance on big maps may correct later

I used Raycasting (wich was i belive unusefully complex for this project)
